#Passion Project#



Prophecy is a web application designed to predict user behavior by analyzing their browser history. By using recent browsing data, Prophecy aims to find patterns and anticipate future actions, providing valuable insights into a user’s interests and preferences.

In the beginning, I will focus on using an individual’s browser history as the primary data source. This data will be exported from Google Chrome and stored in a database, where it can be further analyzed and processed. I plan to fine-tune or train a small language model on this data to enhance its ability to predict user behavior. 

Users can then ask questions to the system to gain insights into their browsing habits and potential future actions.

My MVP will include: dumping browser history data into a database, performing basic analysis, and allowing user to ask questions about their behavior. Use a small LLM to generate predictions and insights.
