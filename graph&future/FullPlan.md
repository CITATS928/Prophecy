Project Overview:

The main goal of this project is to analyze a person’s behavior over a month to predict what they might do next. I focus on things like the websites they visit, what they search for online, their eating habits, entertainment choices, and travel patterns. My analysis gives more importance to recent activities because they are more likely to predict what happens next. For example, if someone recently searched for camping gear on Google, the system might suggest that they are interested in buying camping products, helping stores make better recommendations.

Data Sources and Collection Methods:

Usually, data can get in two ways: users can give us permission to access their behavior data, or get it from third-party data providers. Since collecting real data is difficult, I'm planning to start by using fake data to test and build our system. This lets us see how well our analysis works and prepares us to use real data in the future. 


Analysis Methods:

Start by looking at how different keywords relate to each other and by sorting keywords into categories. This helps to understand user behavior. In the future, I plan to use machine learning to make our predictions even better. This means I’ll train models to recognize more complex patterns in the data and predict more accurately what a user might do next.

Use Cases:

This project can be used in many ways, such as predicting what users will do, what they like, or how they might spend their money. For example, by analyzing someone’s browsing and search history, the system could predict what products or services they might be interested in soon, helping businesses make smarter marketing choices. It can also help users understand their habits better, so they can make more informed decisions.

Project Value:

This project is valuable because it gives businesses tools to market their products more effectively, making marketing more efficient, and provides users with personalized experiences that improve their daily lives. In today’s world, understanding and predicting user behavior is key for businesses. By analyzing individual behavior, this project helps businesses stay competitive and gives users products and services that match their needs.

Project Challenges:

One of the biggest challenges right now is collecting data, especially getting high-quality behavior data in real-world situations. That’s why I'm using fake data in the early stages to build and test our models. Also, even though I'm planning to use machine learning to make predictions, I still need to learn more about how to do this effectively.
